#Project Overview

With this project we the potential employees are trying to make an application that is helpful to almost every person looking for a job. Be it a professional businessman to being a co-op student. As the title suggest we are trying to make a job finding system that is useful for both the employees as well as the employers. With our system the employers can post their job openings on our application, it adds up to the database. While the employee, who is looking for a job can find a job. With this application the employees can search for the kind of job they require by entering their skills and the system will analyse them and show the probable job matches. The employees will be able to access the application without being registered, but if the user wants to apply then they must register. Where as in case of the employers the registration is mandatory. The employer can add, edit or delete their job posting anytime they want to. The functional requirements, use cases and the probable UML diagram for the application goes as follows.
  
  
#Functional Requirements/ Use Case

1)The system will have a new user function where customers and job submitters are required to create an account before using any of the systems functions.

2)After the user has created an account, they are able to choose either two option either post a job or apply for a job within a list.

3)If the user chooses the post a job then he/she must specify the job requirements such as age requirements, work experience and a brief description on the benefits of having that specific job.

4)The job post is then saved to file until another user wishes to apply for a specific job.

5)If the user chooses to apply for a job, the user is required to enter information about his/her self and about the job they want to 
acquire. Then the user searches for potential jobs matching their specific criteria and a list of jobs is displayed.

6)The user then clicks on the job they want from a list and click apply. A confirmation is displayed to assure the user that they have applied for the job.

7)There system will have a logout function that sends users back to the beginning of the system.
